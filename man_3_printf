.SH NAME
_printf

.SH DESCRIPTION
The "printf" function takes a format string as its first argument, which specifies how the output should be formatted. It may contain format specifiers that are replaced by the values of additional arguments.

.SH SYNOPSIS
Here's a simple example that demonstrates the usage of "printf":

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number = 42;
    printf("The answer is %d\n", number);
    return 0;
}
.TP
.BR
In this example, the "%d" format specifier is used to print the value of the variable "number" as a decimal integer.
.TP
.BR
Running this program would output:
The answer is 42
.TP
.BR
The "printf" function supports various format specifiers for different types of data, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and strings. Additionally, it provides options for controlling the field width, precision, and justification of the output.
